                 Git and Git Hub:
                   Git and GitHub are 2 different things

1.	Git:
 Git is a software that comes with the computer if you have Mac or Linux
 For windows you have to download it – Git Bash
 Git is a memory card for your cod
   
                                      If you have a project with a bunch of files (html, css, js) you want just like you have a video game you want to save your progress as you go, that way if you die you don’t loose all your progress
                            
                                                                               This will be saved locally on your computer, nobody can access this


                                                                                     Example:
                                                                                        mkdir gitVideo <- create a folder named gitVideo
                                                                                         cd gitVideo <- access the file
                                                                                         touch index.html app.css <- create index and app files

1.1.	How to use Git:
a.	Initialize your folder with git:
git init = put the memory card into the game system, because you cannot save game without memory
              Now we can use Git!
b.	Save our progress:
git add  = is used to save, we can choose all the project with a dot or a specific file like index.html
git add .
